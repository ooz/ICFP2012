Lightning entry:

 * Nothing special so far: just testing submission process:
    - A*, moving to closest lambda first (greedy), avoid dying at all costs
    - Algorithm ignores any flood information, so drowing is very likely

Plan:
 
 * Always remember a lift connection
 * Lambda cluster detection (getting greedy on clusters instead of single lambdas)
    - maybe: find optional "extraction point" for cluster
 * actively moving rocks, avoid final path blocking
 * maybe: evolutionary optimization of some parameters
